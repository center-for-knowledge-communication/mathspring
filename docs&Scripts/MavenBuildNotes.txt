Maven is being used for dependencies and for building the system on rose.

On rose:

/mnt/net/proj/

Did git clone of mathspring project

Installed maven in /usr/local following these instructions:
https://tecadmin.net/install-apache-maven-on-centos/#

cd mathspring
copied by hand META-INF/context.xml into correct location

cd emailer
mvn install
cd ..
cd servletFramework
mvn install
cd ..
mvn -Denv=beta package
mvn -Denv=production package


To successfully use scripts that use maven:

1.  maven relies on dependencies being installed in the users repo.  THis means
that I must run maven targets with sudo
sudo /usr/local/maven/bin/mvn package
do for emailer and servletFramework

Now can run sudo ./deploybeta which will include maven commands and will find the dependencies in the
sudo repo

To do releases now:

login to rose and go to /mnt/net/proj/mathspring
sudo git pull
sudo ./deploybeta
sudo ./deployprod
