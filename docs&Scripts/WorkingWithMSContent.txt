The directory resources/mathspring/mscontent does not live in the github mathspring repo for
several reasons.  One, it is very large (~4GB) and can't fit in the repo, two is that Java developers do not
need to edit these files or push them.   So the solution is to empty the mscontent folder on github
and place it elsewhere in the cloud.

In my marshallumass google drive (password m4thspr1ng) there is:

mscontent is the mscontent directory with files removed that are unecessary for Java developers.
Removed Flash .fla files,   Removed Edge .an files.    This makes a smaller directory structure.
This directory structure should probably be for download only.   This will have to get remade if anything is added
to the mscontent git repo.

Ideally, I'd like to remove the git repo and host a full mscontent dir on google drive.  I'd then need a download
script that gets just the stuff I need (omit the .FLA and the .an files).



Because the original directories for mscontent are on rose,  I've used a command line tool called
gdrive to put the stuff into the google shared drive.   gdrive is a good tool for linux environments.

   - copy past this output into a browser window.   It will give back a code to copy.
   Return to the list area and paste the code.

Done.

Windows:
Download gdrive from github https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B3X9GlR6EmbncWNLOS1KYWhLVFE&export=download
copy downloads\gdrive-windows-x64.exe c:\windows
gdrive-windows-x64.exe list
do the same as above to get code from web
