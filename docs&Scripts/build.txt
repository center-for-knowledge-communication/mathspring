How to build and release:

Assuming you are using Intellij IDEA with a project configured as it comes out of github:

1.  VCS | Commit Changes  Do PUSH to Git
    -  Make sure PUSH succeeds.   If not there are probably new commits in Github and you will need to do
       VCS | Update Project to get the new changes.

Build war files:
2.   Build | Build Artifacts | woServer:Web-BETA WAR | Build
3.   Build | Build Artifacts | woServer:Web-PRODUCTION WAR | Build

Note:  THere are other options on these menus such as clean, rebuild, etc.  I don't usually
need to use these if I've debugged the code but in rare occasions I may do clean rebuilds.

Move war files to rose:
4.  Open Terminal window
    cd /mathspring/out/artifacts/woServer_Web_Beta_WAR

    check that woj.war is new

5.  scp woj.war marshall@rose.cs.umass.edu:/mnt/net/woj.war
    wait...

6.  cd /mathspring/out/artifacts/woServer_Web_Production_WAR

7.  scp woj.war marshall@rose.cs.umass.edu:/mnt/net/woj.war
    wait...

Get on rose and release the war files.

8.   ssh rose

cd to /mnt/net
verify that woj.war and ms.war are new and are similar bytes to what was on local machine.

Option 1 (No X Windows)

cd /opt/tomcat8/webapps
sudo rm -f woj.war
sudo rm -f ms.war
sudo rm -rf woj
sudo rm -rf ms
cd /mnt/net
./deploywar   # this just copies the woj.war into a sub-folder where woj.war files are
./deployms  # this just copies the ms.war into a sub-folder where ms.war files are
sudo cp woj.war /opt/tomcat8/webapps
sudo cp ms.war /opt/tomcat8/webapps

Tomcat will see the presence of the war files and will automatically expand them and begin
running them.  Verify this by checking that
/opt/tomcat8/webapps/woj  and opt/tomcat8/webapps/ms   are present.



Option 2 (Have X Windows connection to rose)

cd /mnt/net
firefox&
./deploywar
./deployms
In Firefox:
Use tomcat manager to undeploy woj and ms
deploy war file from /mnt/net/production_wars/ms.war
deploy war file from /mnt/net/mathspring-war-file/woj.war


Note:  logs  containing useful error messages that take place in the server are in
/opt/tomcat8/logs/  ms.log and woj.log
