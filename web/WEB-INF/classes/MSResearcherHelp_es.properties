cohort_admin_1=Prerequisites~Before you begin populating the cohort, teachers and classes must be created in Mathspring.  When inputing the school year field, teachers should use the year in which the class ends e.g. a class that goes from Autumn of 2022 to Spring of 2023, would be entered as 2023.  Note: Usernames which are excessively long, such as a long email address, will be less visually appealing in the Workbench charts.  Commands exist in the Workbench for creating and deleting cohort information.
cohort_admin_2=Creating a new cohort~The name field should only include include the characters (A-Z a-z 0-9 -).  The start date field is used by the Workbench to handle weekly data aggregation.  It is best to choose a Sunday.  The school year field should match the year used in the class definitions.
cohort_admin_3=Adding teachers to the cohort~When prompted, enter the teacher last name and the teacher id.
cohort_admin_4=Adding classes to the cohort~When prompted, enter the teacher last name and the class id.
cohort_admin_5=Removing teachers from the cohort~When prompted, enter the teacher last name and the teacher id.
cohort_admin_6=Removing classes from the cohort~When prompted, enter the teacher last name and the class id.
cohort_admin_7=Note~Removing teachers or classes from the cohort only dis-associates the teacher/class from the cohort. It does not impact the Mathspring data.
